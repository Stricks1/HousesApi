# Rails API for rent a place

On this project, I created an API to get houses information for an App. The idea is to create a simplified version of AirBnb. For now, the API manages creating and signing users (utilizing tokens for validating the sessions/saving the machine login), each user can create, edit, and delete their own places. A table for the places and one for images, to link how many pictures you want on each place and favorite places for the users. The API has also prepared a table for creating and cancel reservations on places.

#### Example return login
![Login](./loginSS.png)

#### Example return places
![Places](./placesSS.png)

## Installation

You can get a local copy of the repository please run the following commands on your terminal:

```
$ cd <folder>
$ git clone https://github.com/Stricks1/HousesApi.git
```

### Server Side

The API (server side) is on the folder server. In order to run the server go to the folder run `$ bundle install` to get install the gems needed. After that we need to migrate the db with `$ rails db:migrate`, and finally you can run the server using the command `$ rails server`.
You are ready to access the API on the address `http://localhost:3000/`
Alternatively you can use our already deployed version with an existing database [here](https://houses-api-be.herokuapp.com/)

#### Prerequisites for Running API

Ruby: >= 2.6.5 - Rails >=5.2.4.3

## API Calls

This API requires a login user to be accessible, so when the user is created or login, one JSON property returned is a token that needs to be used on the Header of any Authenticated calls for it to work. The token is also utilized to know what user is accessing the API in order to know if he have access for editing a place/favorite.
The following calls/actions are valid for the API (look the code for more information on detailed returned objects/accepted params):

### Non-authenticated calls:

| TYPE          | URL           | EXPECTED        |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| POST          | /v1/users     | JSON (user info)|
| POST          | /v1/login     | JSON (user info)|

### Authenticated calls:

Every Authenticated call, requires a header named 
`Authorization`
with information `Bearer [token received on login]`

| TYPE          | URL                | EXPECTED                                          |

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails

### Test with

- Rspec
- Faker
- FactoryBot

## Live Version

[Deployed on Heroku](https://houses-api-be.herokuapp.com/)

## Future Implementations

- For future implementations, I consider creating a table for a chat between users so the owner and the renter can speak.
